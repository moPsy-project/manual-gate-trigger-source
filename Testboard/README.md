# Testboard

> Testboard for the Eurorack Module for a manual gate/trigger source

As described in #53, buttons do not always trigger reliably after a cold start,
i.e. a longer period without power.

This happens on all buttons, but only in the finished circuit. The effect could not be observed on the breadboard and is therefore hard to debug.

This board contains only one trigger and some testpoints.

It is meant to be connected to the [Eurorack Power Breakout](https://github.com/moPsy-project/eurorack-power-breakout).
